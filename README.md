# Harnessing-Machine-Learning-to-Anticipate-Hypertension-Risk

## Introduction

This project is a machine learning project that uses the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM algorithms to predict the probability of a patient having a positive Hypertension. The project uses data which contains information on 1000 patients.

## Data Preprocessing

The data is preprocessed by dropping unnecessary columns, filling in missing values, and scaling the features.

## Data Visualization

The data is visualized using bar charts to show the distribution of the different features.

## Data Training and Testing

The data is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the models, and the test set is used to evaluate the models.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.

## Results

The results show that the Random Forest model has the highest accuracy, followed by the Decision Tree model, the SVM model, and the Logistic Regression model.

## Conclusion

The Random Forest and Logistic Regression model is the best model for predicting the probability of a patient having a positive pregnancy test result.
